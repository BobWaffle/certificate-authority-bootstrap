# certificate-authority-bootstrap

This project provides a template and some helper scripts to create your own Root and Intermediate Certificate Authorities.

# Quickstart

## 1) Initialise the Root and Intermediate CAs

### Steps
_This is for *NIX systems._
 
 ```
 # Clone the repository
 git clone https://github.com/BobWaffle/certificate-authority-bootstrap.git
 
 # Change into the repo directory
 cd certificate-authority-bootstrap
 
 # Clone the CA template using the helper script
 ./bin/bootstrap-ca.sh MyNewCA
 
 # Change into the new CA directory
 cd ./private/MyNewCA
 
 # Initialise the Root CA using the helper script
 ./bin/01CreateRootCAKeyAndCert.sh
 
 # Initialise the Intermediate CA using the helper script
 ./bin/02CreateIntermediateCAKeyAndCert.sh
 ```

**DO NOT CUT-AND-PASTE THE ABOVE COMMANDS IN ONE BLOCK**  Why?  Because you're going to be prompted for passwords etc.


## 2) Get Signing

Now you're ready to start signing your own certificates using your intermediate authority.

```
# Make sure you're in the new Certificate Authority directory
cd certificate-authority-bootstrap/private/MyNewCA

# Run the certificate signing helper script
./bin/SignCertificateWithIntermediateCA.sh my.domain.com
```

## 3) [Optional] Trust Your Own CAs

This step allows you to add one or both of your Certificate Authorities to your device(s) on which you want to trust them.

**Why _might_ you do this?**  So you don't get prompted by your device that "The Certificate is not trusted".

**What is the danger of doing this?**  Good question!  I'm glad you asked.  **Remember:**  _Once you trust your own Certificate Authority at the operating system level, you will never see any warnings for SSL certificates that were signed by that Certificate Authority._

**Why is that dangerous?**  Imagine someone got hold of your CA files (and password) and generated an SSL certificate for www.yourbank.com.  They'd then be able to pretend to be https://www.yourbank.com and your browser wouldn't warn you.

**I don't understand** Well... perhaps you shouldn't be mucking around with Certificate Authorites.  Don't say I didn't warn you.

**OK OK - I understand the risks... what do I do?**  Exactly _what_ you do depends on your requirements (do you need to install the Root CA or is the Intermediate CA sufficient?)  One you know which you want to install, simply add the relevant certificate to your operating system's Trusted Certificates.

**I don't know if I should install the Root or Intermediate CA Cert...**
* **If you install the Root CA** then _all certificates signed by the Root CA or any of your intermediate CAs will be trusted_.  (The scripts I have provided only create a single Intermediate CA... but you could choose to make more.)
* **If you install the Intermediate CA** then _only certificates signed by the Intermediate CA will be trusted_.

**Erm... HOW do I trust a CA on my device of type X?**  Google it.
